## Mathematics [X]

We're going to do some basic tests in this file. Math now seems to work using the include above. 


$$
\begin{aligned}
    \prob(X) = y
\end{aligned}
$$


## Python Interpreter [X]

Use an Anaconda environment

```{python}
import torch 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

print(torch.__version__)

X = torch.linspace(0, 10, steps=100)
Y = torch.sin(X)

plt.plot(X.numpy(), Y.numpy())
plt.show()
```

Did we see the thing?
