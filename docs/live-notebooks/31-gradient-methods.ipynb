Then, we use the velocity $\\mathbf{v}^{(t+1)}$ to update our parameters $\\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)}$.

When $\\beta$ is close to 1, we give more weight to the previous velocity, which can help us maintain momentum in a particular direction and potentially escape from local minima or navigate narrow valleys more effectively.
