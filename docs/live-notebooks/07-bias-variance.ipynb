        "# More on Overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "A theoretical framework for reasoning about model complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Several times in these notes, we’ve seen the topic of *overfitting* arise. In this set of lecture notes, we’ll define overfitting more formally. We’ll then look at overfitting from two perspectives: the bias-variance decomposition, and the modern phenomenon of double descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "<span class=\"theorem-title\">**Definition 1 (Overfitting)**</span> *Overfitting* refers to any situation in which increasing the complexity of a model causes the model to improve its performance on training data but *worsen* its performance on test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of the signal + noise paradigm of modeling,\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "y & = f(x) + \\epsilon\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "overfitting occurs when an estimator begins to approximate the noise $\\epsilon$ rather than the signal $f(x)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "For several decades, the received wisdom in the statistics and machine learning communities was that models begin to overfit when they become “too complex.” Model complexity is frequently measured in terms of the number of parameters present in the model. So far in these notes, we’ve exclusively studied models where the number of parameters is equal to the number of features, so another way to think about model complexity is in terms of the total number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Bias-Variance Decomposition\n",
        "\n",
        "One theoretical view of the sources of overfitting comes from the *bias-variance* decomposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Many data sets, many models\n",
        "\n",
        "In the bias-variance decomposition, we consider a *series* of experiments. In each experiment, we pull a data set $(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})$ from some data generating distribution, fit a model to that data, and then make a prediction about an element $Y$ in the test set. Since the data set we pull in each experiment is random, the value $Y$ in the test set is random. Furthermore, since the training data is random, the fitted model $\\hat{f}$ and the resulting prediction $\\hat{Y}$ will also be random.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s illustrate the setup. For the experiments in this chapter, we need to run a LOT of regression models. For this reason, we’ll use a special, very efficient implementation of linear regression that allows us to fit models in closed form. This is not a general approach to fitting models, but it will allow us to run the experiments in this chapter much more quickly."

        "Now we’ll illustrate generating many data sets from the same data generating distribution, fitting a model, and making a prediction $\\hat{Y}$ for some new unseen point $x$ in the test set. For today, we’ll consider the following data generating function, which accepts a fixed set of inputs $x$ and generates a random output $y$ for each input according to the signal + noise paradigm. Unlike in many other models, this particular data generating process gets noisier as $x$ increases, which will allow us to illustrate how the bias and variance of the model can vary across different regions of the input space."

        "For a long time in statistics and machine learning, the single-descent curve offered the primary way in which we thought about model complexity. Models with low complexity underfit the data (high bias, low variance), while models with high complexity overfit the data (low bias, high variance). The optimal model complexity balanced these two sources of error to minimize test error. The key was to get *enough* complexity while *avoiding* overfitting. The thing you never wanted to do was to *interpolate* the data, since interpolation is perfect overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "This theoretical story was challenged by the advent of deep learning as a practical tool. Modern deep learning models often have parameter counts in the billions or trillions, which in principle is often enough to perfectly interpolate training data. So why is it that these models nevertheless successfully generalize?\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out that there are both *bad* and *good* ways to interpolate your data. Models that have the capacity for “good” interpolation can achieve very low test error even while interpolating the training data. Let’s see an example. <span class=\"column-margin margin-aside\">This example was inspired by [Manuchehr Aminian](https://maminian.github.io/)’s [blog post](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/characterizations-of-double-descent/) in SIAM News on double descent.</span>\n",

This is because double descent is primarily a phenomenon that takes place for models with very large parameter counts. Since we want to illustrate this phenomenon in a way that’s easy to visualize, we have to set things up to make sure it happens here.</span>\n",
