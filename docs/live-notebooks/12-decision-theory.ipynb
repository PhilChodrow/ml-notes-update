        "[Last time](11-assessment-of-classifiers.qmd), we studied a range of metrics for evaluating the performance of a classification model based purely on the correctness or incorrectness of the model’s predictions. In practice, however, we don’t typically use predictive models *just* for predictions – we use them to *inform decisions*.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not it will rain tomorrow is used to help me *decide* whether or not to bring an umbrella.\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not a tumor is malignant based on medical imaging is used to help a doctor *decide* what treatment to recommend.\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not a customer will click on an ad is used to help an advertiser *decide* how much to bid for that ad placement.\n",

        "\n",
        "An important property of decision-making in the real world is that there are *costs* and *benefits* associated with each entry of the confusion matrix. In the example of weather prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **True Negative (TN)**: The model predicts no rain, and no rain occurs. I do not bring my umbrella, but I remain dry and happy.\n",
        "2.  **False Positive (FP)**: The model predicts rain, but no rain occurs. I bring my umbrella unnecessarily. I am dry and happy, though slightly inconvenienced.\n",
        "3.  **False Negative (FN)**: The model predicts no rain, but it rains. I do not bring my umbrella. I am soaked and unhappy.\n",
        "4.  **True Positive (TP)**: The model predicts rain, and it rains. I bring my umbrella, and I remain dry and happy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of these four outcomes, the false negative outcome is by far the worst. Thus, if the sole purpose of my model is to help me decide whether or not to bring an umbrella, I should want the model not just to be *accurate overall*, but more specifically to *minimize false negatives* (within reason).\n",

        "## Cost in Decision Making\n",
        "\n",
        "Somewhat more generally, I can assign numerical scores to each of the four outcomes in the confusion matrix, each of which represent the *Cost* associated with that outcome.\n",

        "Suppose that I evaluated my model on a validation set of 100 examples, finding that the model made 70 true negative predictions, 10 false positives, 5 false negatives, and 15 true positives. I can collect these in the confusion matrix, and then assign costs to each entry of the confusion matrix, as follows:\n",

        "> -   An early automated screen for a rare disease may be used to order expensive follow-up tests. The cost of a false positive is that an unnecessary, costly follow-up test is performed, while the cost of a false negative is that the disease may go undetected and untreated. Constructing a cost matrix here requires matching the “units” of cost in each of these cases, which may in practice mean that a dollar value must be assigned to human health or human life.\n",

        ">\n",
        "> Unfortunately it’s often not practical to train the model directly to minimize the expected cost. One of the primary reasons is that the entries of the confusion matrix (like the number of false positives, for example) are not differentiable functions of the model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$. This means that we can’t use gradient-based optimization to directly minimize the expected cost.\n",
