        "[Last time](11-assessment-of-classifiers.qmd), we studied a range of metrics for evaluating the performance of a classification model based purely on the correctness or incorrectness of the model’s predictions. In practice, however, we don’t typically use predictive models *just* for predictions – we use them to *inform decisions*.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not it will rain tomorrow is used to help me *decide* whether or not to bring an umbrella.\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not a tumor is malignant based on medical imaging is used to help a doctor *decide* what treatment to recommend.\n",
        "-   A model which *predicts* whether or not a customer will click on an ad is used to help an advertiser *decide* how much to bid for that ad placement.\n",

        "An important property of decision-making in the real world is that there are *costs* and *benefits* associated with each entry of the confusion matrix. In the example of weather prediction:\n",

        "1.  **True Negative (TN)**: The model predicts no rain, and no rain occurs. I do not bring my umbrella, but I remain dry and happy.\n",

        "3.  **False Negative (FN)**: The model predicts no rain, but it rains. I do not bring my umbrella. I am soaked and unhappy.\n",
        "4.  **True Positive (TP)**: The model predicts rain, and it rains. I bring my umbrella, and I remain dry and happy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of these four outcomes, the false negative outcome is by far the worst. Thus, if the sole purpose of my model is to help me decide whether or not to bring an umbrella, I should want the model not just to be *accurate overall*, but more specifically to *minimize false negatives* (within reason).\n",

The cost of a false positive is that an unnecessary, costly follow-up test is performed, while the cost of a false negative is that the disease may go undetected and untreated.

One of the primary reasons is that the entries of the confusion matrix (like the number of false positives, for example) are not differentiable functions of the model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$.

In some cases, the model may be very uncertain about its prediction for a given patient, and it may be desirable for the model to have the option to “reject” making a prediction for that patient, and instead pass the data off to a human expert for further analysis.
