        "In this set of notes, we’ll begin our investigation into *classification*. Whereas in regression we aimed to predict a *number* (like an amount of rainfall, or the price of a house), in classification we aim to predict a *category* (like whether an email is spam or not, or whether a tumor is malignant or benign).\n",

        "### Classification and Decision-Making\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification is in many contexts a more practically-relevant task than regression, because classification relates directly to decision-making. For example, consider a spam filter. The goal of a spam filter is to classify incoming emails as either “spam” or “not spam”. This classification directly informs the decision of whether to deliver the email to the user’s inbox or to the spam folder.\n",

For classification we still want to use the “signal + noise” paradigm, but the presence of categorical data means that we need to make some adjustments to the framework. In particular, since $y_i$ is now a category rather than number, we can’t write it as the “sum” of anything, so our idea of “signal + noise” will be a bit metaphorical.\n",
