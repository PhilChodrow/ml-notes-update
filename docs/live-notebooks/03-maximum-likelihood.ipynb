        "[Last time](02-signal-noise.qmd), we introduced the idea of modeling data as signal + noise, studied the Gaussian distribution as a model of noise, and introduced the linear-Gaussian model for prediction in the context of linear trends. We also derived the log-likelihood function for the linear-Gaussian model and introduced the idea that we could learn the signal of the data by maximizing the log-likelihood with respect to the model parameters. In this chapter, we’ll begin our study of how to maximize the likelihood systematically using tools from calculus.\n",
